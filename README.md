### What is Dexter?
Dexter is a [HAR file](https://www.maxcdn.com/one/visual-glossary/har-file/) proxy server.

### Why Dexter?
Dexter is simple, very light weight and blazingly fast. Instead of running your entire development server on your machine, just run Dexter and point your Grunt / Gulp proxy server to it.
